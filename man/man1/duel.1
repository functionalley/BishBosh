.TH duel 1
.SH NAME
\fBduel\fR - Stages a duel using two opposing instances of \fBbishbosh\fR
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbishbosh\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An application which automatically plays chess, by forking two independently configured instances of \fBbishbosh\fR.
One instance automates the moves of White & the other automates the moves of Black.
This application merely acts as an intermediary, passing moves between these instances to synchronise their positions,
while measuring the total time taken by either side & collating the game-results to permit comparison of the fitness of their respective configurations.
.PP
This process facilitates optimisation of the complex configuration of \fBbishbosh\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--verbosity=\fR(\fBSilent\fR|\fBNormal\fR|\fBVerbose\fR|\fBDeafening\fR), defaulting to "\fBNormal\fR".
Defines the quantity of ancillary output required.
.TP
\fB-d\fR \fIInt\fR, \fB--nDecimalDigits=\fR\fIInt\fR, defaulting to "\fB0\fR".
The precision with which to display the total time taken by each side.
.TP
\fB-n\fR \fIInt\fR, \fB--nGames=\fR\fIInt\fR, defaulting to "\fB1\fR".
The number of games to be played before presenting the results.
.TP
\fB-t\fR \fIInt\fR, \fB--readTimeout=\fR\fIInt\fR, defaulting to \fIindefinitely\fR.
The number of seconds to wait for one of the forked processes to return a move, before aborting.
CAVEAT: the period typically required depends on;
.IP \(bu
the machine's speed,
.IP \(bu
what else is running on the machine,
.IP \(bu
the size of the machine's RAM,
.IP \(bu
\fBbishbosh\fR's configuration (e.g. search-depth or fitness-evaluation criteria).
.TP
\fB-i\fR \fIFile-path\fR, \fB--appendInputConfigFilePath=\fR\fIFile-path\fR; there is no default.
Define the path to a configuration-file to forward to \fBbishbosh\fR.
Two such paths are required, the first will be passed to the instance playing White & the second to the instance playing Black.
.SS "Generic Program-information"
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--version\fR
Outputs version-information & then exits.
.TP
\fB-?\fR, \fB--help\fR
Displays a usage-message & then exits.
.SH EXIT-STATUS
\fB0\fR on success, & >\fB0\fR if an error occurs.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.B duel --verbosity='Verbose' --nGames=128 -i 'config/Raw/bishbosh_duel_white.xml' -i 'config/Raw/bishbosh_duel_black.xml'
.fi
.IP \(bu
The application has been instructed to provide a relatively large amount of feedback.
.IP \(bu
Two packaged configuration-files have been referenced, the first referring to the instance playing White, as required.
.IP \(bu
CAVEAT: assumes that the executable exists on \fB$PATH\fR, otherwise an explicit path will be required.
.PP
.nf
.B make duel
.fi
.IP \(bu
The same as above.
.IP \(bu
The current working directory must be \fBbishbosh\fR's installation-directory where the required \fBmakefile\fR is defined.
